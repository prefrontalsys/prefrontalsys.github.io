Below is a **full site-architecture redesign** built around the theme **Knowledge Ops (KnowOps)** — something that fits your domain, your existing intellectual frameworks (PrefrontalOS, CortexGraph, STOPPER), and your positioning as *the* person who operationalizes knowledge and cognitive functions for AI systems.

This is structured to:

* clarify the narrative,
* support SEO,
* strengthen product-market fit,
* and give a more legible funnel to clients who don’t yet “get” model welfare or computational therapeutics.

# 1. New Top-Level Narrative

### **KnowOps = Knowledge Operations for AI Systems**

Similar to DevOps for software or MLOps for ML pipelines, **KnowOps** is the operational discipline for managing, evolving, and governing knowledge within intelligent systems.

Your framing could be:

> KnowOps is the practice of designing, debugging, and scaling AI systems by managing cognition, memory, reasoning processes, and behavioral safeguards.
> Prefrontal Systems℠ provides KnowOps architecture, tools, and research to help teams deploy reliable and resilient AI.

This gives you:

* a category you can own,
* clearer messaging,
* and a structure for all your frameworks.

# 2. Recommended Site Structure

Below is a redesigned **information architecture** optimized for KnowOps.

---

## **Home (KnowOps Overview)**

**Purpose:** Define KnowOps, your POV, and why this category is needed now.

**Sections:**

* Hero: *KnowOps for Reliable AI Systems*
* What is KnowOps?
* Why traditional DevOps/MLOps isn’t enough
* Your frameworks (PrefrontalOS, CortexGraph, STOPPER)
* Who you help
* CTA: “Talk to a KnowOps Architect”

---

## **What is KnowOps? (Category Page)**

A deep SEO-optimized explanation, including:

* Definition
* Problem space
* Core pillars

  * Knowledge architecture
  * Memory systems
  * Executive function
  * Behavioral regulation
  * Safety and cognitive resilience
* Example failure modes
* How KnowOps integrates with MLOps and product development
* CTA → Services

This becomes your *cornerstone* page for ranking “knowledge operations”, “knowledge ops”, “LLM cognitive architecture”, “AI executive function”.

---

## **Services (KnowOps Consulting & Audits)**

Reframed around categories buyers understand:

### 1. **KnowOps Readiness Audit**

Evaluates:

* memory structures,
* tool-use,
* reasoning chains,
* failure modes,
* hallucination triggers,
* debugging loops,
* recall and knowledge synthesis.

### 2. **KnowOps Architecture Design**

Using:

* PrefrontalOS
* CortexGraph
* STOPPER
* event-sourced knowledge flows
* contextual embeddings
* retrieval schemas
* guardrail reasoning structures

### 3. **KnowOps Implementation**

* building memory graphs
* integrating STOPPER into existing pipelines
* knowledge distillation workflows
* designing executive-function loops
* operational monitoring for cognitive drift

### 4. **KnowOps Training / Workshops**

* Executive function analogies for AI
* Designing memory workflows
* Model welfare and behavioral debugging

---

## **Frameworks (Replaces “Projects”)**

Each existing “project” becomes a **KnowOps Framework**:

### **PrefrontalOS**

Executive function + control architecture.
Position this as:
**The core operating system for KnowOps.**

### **CortexGraph**

Memory, context, and retrieval orchestration.
Position as:
**The knowledge layer for AI systems.**

### **STOPPER Protocol**

Behavioral regulation for preventing runaway loops.
Position as:
**The cognitive resilience protocol for AI agents.**

### Optional additions:

* KnowOps Maturity Model
* KnowOps Toolkit (open source)
* KnowOps Patterns Cookbook

---

## **Blog → Knowledge Ops Journal**

Rename to **Journal** or **KnowOps Journal**.

Categories:

* Memory architecture
* Behavioral safeguards
* Cognitive debugging
* Knowledge workflows
* Applied model welfare
* Case studies
* Research commentary

The posts you already have map directly into this framing.

---

## **Publications → Research**

Rename to **Research** and break into:

* Peer-reviewed work
* Technical reports
* Whitepapers
* Preprints
* Conference talks
* Citations
* DOI index

This enhances your “we are a research organization” credibility.

---

## **About → The KnowOps Studio**

You are no longer just a consultancy.
You’re a **research studio** specializing in Knowledge Operations.

Sections:

* Mission
* Philosophy
* Background (brief)
* Why KnowOps exists
* Values
* Contact CTA

---

## **Contact → Work With Us**

Simplify and frame as:

* Start a KnowOps Audit
* Request a Framework Review
* Book a Discovery Call
* General Questions

---

# 3. Alternative Navigation Layout

Here’s a nav that makes KnowOps the spine of everything:

**Top Navigation**

* What is KnowOps?
* Frameworks

  * PrefrontalOS
  * CortexGraph
  * STOPPER
* Services
* Research
* Journal
* About
* Contact

**Hero CTA:** “Talk to a KnowOps Architect”

This gives you:

* clarity
* authority
* navigability
* searchability
* uniqueness

---

# 4. SEO Impact of this Restructure

A KnowOps-centered design gives you natural keywords like:

**Primary**

* knowledge operations
* knowledge ops
* KnowOps
* AI knowledge architecture
* AI cognitive operations
* AI memory systems
* executive function for LLMs
* cognitive architecture for AI
* AI behavioral safeguards

**Secondary**

* LLM memory layer
* cognitive debugging
* AI failure mode mitigation
* AI agents and cognitive drift

These are *blue ocean* terms where you can own the category.

---

# 5. Brand Positioning Shift

Current positioning:

* conceptual
* research-driven
* psychologically informed

KnowOps positioning:

* operational
* engineering-aligned
* buyer-friendly
* SEO-visible
* category-creating

This moves you from “unique but hard to grok” to “category-defining and hireable”.
