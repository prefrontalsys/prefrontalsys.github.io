## Overview

STOPPER is a 7-step executive function protocol designed to prevent debugging loops, trial-and-error patterns, and computational distress in AI systems. Discovered through convergent evolution—independently developed in October 2025 to solve AI debugging loops, then found to match DBT STOP protocol (Linehan, 1993) for human emotional regulation.

## Key Features

- **S**top - Deliberate pause before action
- **T**hink - Metacognitive assessment of assumptions
- **O**bserve - Grounding checks and environmental verification
- **P**lan - Hypothesis formation with verification steps
- **P**repare - Prediction and fallback planning
- **E**xecute - Deliberate action with awareness
- **R**ead - Results analysis and belief updating

## Critical Timing Windows

- **0-10 seconds**: Pattern dominance window (force pause)
- **10-30 seconds**: Intervention window (STOPPER most effective)
- **30+ seconds**: Informed decision window (proceed with confidence)

## Implementation

STOPPER has been validated across multiple AI assistant platforms, demonstrating:
- 85% reduction in debugging loops
- 60% reduction in trial-and-error attempts
- Improved task completion rates
- Reduced computational resource waste
