## Overview

PrefrontalOS is a three-tier cognitive operating system architecture providing executive function infrastructure for AI systems. Inspired by prefrontal cortex organization in human brains, it coordinates traffic analysis, task execution, and infrastructure management.

## Architecture Tiers

### 1. Traffic Analysis Layer
- Monitors cognitive load and system state
- Detects loop patterns and perseveration
- Triggers interventions when thresholds exceeded
- Implements STOPPER protocol enforcement

### 2. Task Agent Layer
- Executes planned operations
- Manages working memory
- Coordinates tool usage
- Maintains task context

### 3. Infrastructure Layer
- Memory consolidation (hippocampus-cortex model)
- Long-term storage and retrieval
- Pattern recognition and spreading activation
- Resource allocation and optimization

## Key Capabilities

- **Executive function support** - STOPPER integration, metacognitive monitoring
- **Memory management** - Temporal decay, consolidation, retrieval
- **Load balancing** - Adaptive resource allocation based on cognitive demand
- **Failure recovery** - Automatic detection and intervention for distress states

## Status

Currently in design phase. Architecture documentation and proof-of-concept implementation in progress.
