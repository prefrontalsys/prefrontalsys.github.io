We help teams implement Knowledge Operations (KnowOps) to make their AI systems more reliable, debuggable, and cognitively resilient.

Whether you're just starting to think about cognitive architecture or ready to deploy production frameworks, we offer services tailored to your needs.

## KnowOps Readiness Audit

**Evaluate your AI system's cognitive architecture and identify failure modes**

### What we evaluate:
- Memory structures and retrieval patterns
- Tool-use strategies and integration points
- Reasoning chains and decision-making logic
- Common failure modes and edge cases
- Hallucination triggers and mitigation
- Debugging loops and recovery mechanisms
- Recall accuracy and knowledge synthesis

### Deliverables:
- Detailed audit report with findings
- Prioritized recommendations
- Risk assessment matrix
- Roadmap for KnowOps implementation

### Ideal for:
Teams deploying AI agents or assistants who want to understand their system's cognitive strengths and weaknesses before scaling.
