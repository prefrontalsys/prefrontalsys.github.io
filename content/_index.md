# KnowOps for Reliable AI Systems

**Knowledge Operations (KnowOps)** is the operational discipline for managing cognition, memory, reasoning processes, and behavioral safeguards in intelligent systems.

Just as DevOps transformed software delivery and MLOps brought rigor to machine learning pipelines, KnowOps provides the architecture and tooling to make AI systems reliable, debuggable, and cognitively resilient.

## What is KnowOps?

Traditional AI development focuses on models, APIs, and infrastructure. But production AI systems fail in ways that aren't about training or deployment:

- Memory failures (hallucinations, forgetting context)
- Reasoning loops (circular logic, getting stuck)
- Behavioral runaway (cascading failures)
- Goal drift (losing track of objectives)

These are **cognitive architecture problems**, not infrastructure problems.

KnowOps treats AI systems as cognitive agents that need:
- **Memory management**: What to remember, forget, and recall
- **Executive function**: Goal tracking, attention allocation, behavioral regulation
- **Knowledge architecture**: How information flows and understanding evolves

## Why DevOps and MLOps Aren't Enough

**DevOps** assumes stateless services and deterministic behavior. AI systems have memory, evolve understanding, and make probabilistic decisions.

**MLOps** treats models as black boxes to train and serve. It doesn't address how models *think*, *remember*, or *regulate behavior*.

**KnowOps** fills this gap with frameworks for cognitive architecture, memory systems, and behavioral safeguards.

## KnowOps Frameworks

We provide open-source frameworks for building reliable AI systems:

### PrefrontalOS
**The core operating system for KnowOps**

Executive function and control architecture for AI systems. Goal tracking, attention allocation, and metacognitive monitoring.

### CortexGraph
**The knowledge layer for AI systems**

Memory, context, and retrieval orchestration with human-like forgetting curves. Temporal memory management inspired by cognitive psychology.

### STOPPER Protocol
**The cognitive resilience protocol for AI agents**

Behavioral regulation for preventing runaway loops and cascading failures. Based on convergent evolution with DBT STOP techniques.
