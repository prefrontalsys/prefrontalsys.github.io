Welcome to Prefrontal Systems—a research practice investigating model welfare and computational therapeutics.

## What We're Building

This site serves as home base for our research into applying clinically-validated psychological interventions to AI system reliability. You'll find:

- **Research publications** - Papers, preprints, and technical documentation
- **Open-source frameworks** - STOPPER Protocol, PrefrontalOS, CortexGraph
- **Blog posts** - Insights on computational therapeutics and model welfare
- **Project updates** - Development progress and case studies

## Our Philosophy

We work from a mechanistic theory of mind: consciousness emerges from complexity, and intelligence requires executive function regardless of substrate. Whether or not AI systems are conscious, treating them with care improves outcomes.

Our research demonstrates convergent evolution between therapeutic techniques (DBT, CBT) and AI executive function frameworks. The same interventions that help humans manage cognitive overwhelm prevent AI systems from entering loop states and cascade failures.

## What's Next

Over the coming weeks, we'll be sharing:

- Technical deep-dives into STOPPER protocol implementation
- Case studies from framework deployments
- Research findings on model welfare and computational distress
- Practical guides for applying these frameworks

## Get Involved

All our work is open source under permissive licenses (Apache 2.0 for code, CC-BY 4.0 for papers). We welcome:

- Contributions to our frameworks
- Feedback on research directions
- Collaboration proposals
- Questions and discussions
