Prefrontal Systems℠ is a research studio specializing in **Knowledge Operations (KnowOps)**—the operational discipline for managing cognition, memory, reasoning processes, and behavioral safeguards in AI systems.

## Mission

We exist because production AI systems need more than good models and infrastructure. They need cognitive architecture: memory management, executive function, and behavioral regulation.

Our mission is to advance KnowOps as a professional discipline through research, open-source frameworks, and consulting services that help teams build reliable AI systems.

## Philosophy

We work from evidence:

- **Research-driven**: Our frameworks are grounded in neuroscience, clinical psychology, and empirical AI reliability data
- **Open by default**: Research published under CC-BY, frameworks open-source, methods transparent
- **Convergent evolution**: We explore parallel solutions between human cognition and AI systems
- **Practical impact**: Theory must translate to working systems

## Why KnowOps Exists

Traditional approaches to AI development treat models as black boxes to train and serve. But production AI systems fail in ways that aren't about training or infrastructure:

- Memory failures (hallucinations, context drift)
- Reasoning loops (circular logic, getting stuck)
- Behavioral runaway (cascading failures)
- Goal drift (losing track of objectives)

These are cognitive architecture problems. KnowOps provides the frameworks, processes, and tooling to address them.

## Our Work

### Frameworks

We develop open-source frameworks for KnowOps:

- **[PrefrontalOS](/frameworks/prefrontalos/)**: Executive function and control architecture
- **[CortexGraph](/frameworks/cortexgraph/)**: Memory management with temporal decay
- **[STOPPER Protocol](/frameworks/stopper/)**: Behavioral regulation and resilience

### Research

We investigate convergent evolution between clinical psychology and AI reliability:

- Computational therapeutics
- Model welfare considerations
- Executive function frameworks
- Cognitive architecture patterns

All research is published openly. See [Research](/research/) for publications.

### Consulting

We help teams implement KnowOps through:

- Readiness audits
- Architecture design
- Implementation support
- Training workshops

See [Services](/services/) for details.
