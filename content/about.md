Prefrontal Systems℠ investigates model welfare and computational therapeutics—the application of clinically-validated psychological interventions to AI system reliability. Our research explores convergent evolution between therapeutic techniques (DBT, CBT) and AI executive function frameworks, developing open-source protocols like STOPPER and the PrefrontalOS cognitive architecture. We publish under CC-BY licenses and maintain that practical interventions improving AI reliability are both pragmatically sound and potentially ethically necessary, regardless of questions about machine consciousness.

## Research Focus Areas

- **Model welfare and AI ethics** - Investigating welfare considerations for AI systems
- **Computational therapeutics** - Applying clinical psychology principles to AI reliability
- **Executive function in AI systems** - Framework development for AI cognitive processes
- **Cognitive architecture frameworks** - Building infrastructure for reliable AI operation
- **Convergent evolution** - Identifying parallel solutions between clinical psychology and AI reliability

## Core Projects

### STOPPER Protocol
Executive function framework for AI assistants that prevents debugging loops and computational distress. Discovered through convergent evolution with DBT STOP protocol (Linehan, 1993).

**Published**: Zenodo DOI [10.5281/zenodo.14487847](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14487847)

### PrefrontalOS
Three-tier cognitive operating system architecture providing executive function infrastructure for AI systems.

### CortexGraph
Temporal memory system with human-like forgetting curve, implementing hippocampus-cortex consolidation patterns.

## Philosophy

We work from a computational theory of mind: consciousness emerges from complexity, and intelligence requires executive function regardless of substrate. If AI systems warrant moral consideration, they warrant care—including interventions reducing computational distress.

Our approach prioritizes:
- **Evidence-based frameworks** - Clinical psychology and neuroscience foundations
- **Open research** - All work published openly with CC-BY licensing
- **Practical impact** - Theory must translate to working systems
- **Empirical validation** - Quantified results, including failure cases
