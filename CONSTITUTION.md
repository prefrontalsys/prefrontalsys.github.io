## **Prefrontal Systems℠ — Website Constitution (Speckit)**

### **Purpose**

This constitution defines the foundational goals, governance principles, and operational standards for the Prefrontal Systems℠ website. It ensures conceptual coherence, technical quality, and long-term maintainability while establishing **Knowledge Operations (KnowOps)** as a formal discipline.

---

## **1. Mission of the Website**

The website exists to:

1. Define **KnowOps (Knowledge Operations)** as a legitimate and distinct professional field.
2. Provide the authoritative reference materials for KnowOps theory, frameworks, and practice.
3. Serve as a public interface for Prefrontal Systems℠ research, consulting, and thought leadership.
4. Offer a clear, accessible pathway for organizations seeking AI reliability, model welfare, and cognitive architecture expertise.

The primary purpose is category creation, clarity, and stewardship.

---

## **2. Core Narrative Principles**

All content must adhere to the following narrative standards:

* The website presents **KnowOps** as the operational backbone for reliable AI systems.
* Frameworks such as **PrefrontalOS**, **CortexGraph**, and **STOPPER** must be shown as interconnected components of a unified cognitive architecture.
* Every page must reinforce the idea that AI systems benefit from structures analogous to memory, executive function, and behavioral regulation.
* The voice and tone emphasize clarity, methodological rigor, and conceptual accessibility.
* The site must support newcomers while rewarding deep technical and philosophical engagement.

---

## **3. Structural Goals (Information Architecture)**

The information architecture must:

* Make KnowOps immediately intelligible to new visitors.
* Provide a clear path to:

  * What is KnowOps?
  * Frameworks
  * Services
  * Research
  * Journal
  * Contact
* Keep conceptual pages, framework pages, and commercial pages distinct but interlinked.
* Ensure all frameworks have first-class status with dedicated, version-controlled pages.
* Maintain a coherent navigation structure across desktop and mobile.

---

## **4. Content Governance Guidelines**

### **4.1 Page Types**

All pages fall into one of the following types:

* **Canonical Concepts**: Definitions, explainers, cornerstone content
* **Framework Documentation**: PrefrontalOS, CortexGraph, STOPPER, etc.
* **Research Outputs**: Publications, whitepapers, DOIs, preprints
* **Service Descriptions**: Consulting, audits, workshops
* **Journal Entries**: Thought leadership, updates, cases, commentary
* **Engagement Pages**: About, Contact, Work With Us

Each type has its own review and update expectations.

### **4.2 Review Standards**

* Content must be conceptually accurate, aligned with the KnowOps framework.
* Updates to Key Frameworks require:

  * version bump
  * changelog entry
  * explicit note on backwards compatibility or conceptual shifts
* Journal entries require:

  * conceptual alignment check
  * tagging (memory, cognition, failure modes, etc.)
* All edits are reviewed for clarity and narrative coherence.

---

## **5. Terminology and Lexicon Stewardship**

The constitution protects terminology such as:

* KnowOps / Knowledge Operations
* PrefrontalOS
* CortexGraph
* STOPPER
* Cognitive drift
* Behavioral loops
* Executive function (in AI systems)
* Model welfare
* Computational therapeutics

Guidelines:

* Terms must be used consistently across pages.
* New terms require:

  * definition in the Lexicon
  * justification for inclusion
  * cross-references to existing concepts

---

## **6. Research Integrity and Provenance**

The website must maintain:

* Accurate citations for all research.
* Clear differentiation between:

  * empirical research
  * conceptual frameworks
  * speculative or exploratory content
* Transparent provenance of frameworks and their evolution.
* DOI-linked publications where possible.

This ensures the site stands as a credible research artifact.

---

## **7. Technical Quality Standards**

The site must uphold the following:

* Accessible, semantic HTML
* WCAG-aligned design principles
* Fast load times and minimal page weight
* Strict responsiveness across devices
* Consistent spacing, typography, and UI patterns
* Valid metadata:

  * titles
  * meta descriptions
  * canonical tags
  * OpenGraph
  * schema/JSON-LD
* Logical internal linking to support discovery and SEO

---

## **8. Evolution and Lifecycle of Ideas**

This constitution recognizes that Prefrontal Systems℠ is an evolving research studio.

### **8.1 Content Lifecycle**

Each page or concept exists in one of the following states:

* **Draft**
* **Active**
* **Mature / Stable**
* **Deprecated**

Pages must carry a lifecycle note where appropriate.

### **8.2 Change Process**

All significant changes require:

* A GitHub issue describing the proposed update
* A rationale aligned with KnowOps principles
* Linking the change to affected frameworks
* A note in `CHANGELOG.md` if a framework is involved
* Version increments for framework specs

---

## **9. Brand Integrity and Conceptual Cohesion**

Brand alignment requires:

* Consistent voice and tone
* Clear articulation of purpose
* Visual identity coherence
* Avoidance of jargon unless defined
* Strong conceptual through-lines tied back to KnowOps

The brand should feel rigorous, thoughtful, and grounded in cognitive systems engineering.

---

## **10. External Integration and Ecosystem Growth**

The website must facilitate:

* Clear links to GitHub repositories
* Easy citation of frameworks and research
* Integration with external tools, publications, and collaborations
* Opportunities for community involvement where appropriate
* Clarity in how KnowOps interfaces with MLOps, DevOps, safety engineering, and cognitive architectures

---

## **11. Stewardship and Responsibility**

Responsibility for the site rests with:

* **The Founder / Principal Architect** (you)
* Optional contributors approved via GitHub governance
* External collaborators with clear review boundaries

The constitution ensures stability, conceptual integrity, and transparent evolution.

---

## **12. Amendment Process**

This constitution may be amended through:

1. A GitHub issue proposing changes
2. A review of conceptual impact
3. Approval and merge by the steward(s)
4. Update to the version header in this file
5. Optional site-wide announcement for major changes

---

## **Version**

* **v1.0.0**
* Created for Prefrontal Systems℠
* Establishes foundational governance for the KnowOps website
