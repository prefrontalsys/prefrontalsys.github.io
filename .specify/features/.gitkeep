# Features Directory

This directory contains active feature specifications, plans, tasks, and checklists.

When starting a new feature:
1. Copy templates from ../templates/
2. Rename with feature name (e.g., landing-page-redesign-spec.md)
3. Fill out specification first, then plan, then tasks
4. Use checklist throughout implementation

Completed features can be archived or deleted after successful deployment.
