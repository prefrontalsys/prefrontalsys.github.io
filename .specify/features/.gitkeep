# Features Directory (Legacy)

This directory is maintained for backward compatibility but is no longer the primary location for feature specifications.

**Current Workflow**: New features should be created in `.specify/specs/` using the `create-new-feature.sh` script:

```bash
.specify/scripts/bash/create-new-feature.sh --number 1 --short-name "my-feature" "Feature description"
```

This script will automatically create a structured directory under `.specify/specs/` with spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md, and checklists/.
