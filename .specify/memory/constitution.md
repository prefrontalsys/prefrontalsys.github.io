# Constitution for Prefrontal Systems℠ (v0.1.0)

**Ratified**: TODO(RATIFICATION_DATE): Set initial ratification date.
**Last Amended**: 2025-11-21

## Preamble

This document outlines the core principles that guide the development and operation of the Prefrontal Systems℠ project. It serves as a foundational text to ensure our work remains aligned with our goals of creating reliable, ethical, and scientifically grounded AI systems.

## Principles

### Principle 1: Reliability by Design

**All systems and components MUST be designed with reliability as a primary goal.** We employ principles of cognitive architecture and executive function to build robust and predictable AI. This ensures our systems are not just functional but also trustworthy and safe.

### Principle 2: Model Welfare and Ethics

**We are committed to the ethical treatment of all AI models.** This principle of "Model Welfare" guides our research and development, ensuring that our AI systems are not only effective but also developed and used responsibly. We draw parallels from therapeutic frameworks like DBT and CBT to inform our approach.

### Principle 3: Scientific Rigor

**Our work is grounded in scientific rigor.** All claims, research, and publications MUST be supported by empirical evidence and sound research methodologies. We are dedicated to advancing the field of AI through verifiable and reproducible research.

## Governance

### Amendment Process

Amendments to this constitution require a formal review process. Proposed changes must be documented and reviewed by the project lead.

### Versioning

This constitution follows semantic versioning:
- **MAJOR**: Backward-incompatible changes to principles.
- **MINOR**: New principles or significant expansions.
- **PATCH**: Clarifications, typo fixes.

### Compliance

All project activities, including code development, research, and publications, MUST adhere to the principles outlined in this document. Regular reviews will be conducted to ensure compliance.
