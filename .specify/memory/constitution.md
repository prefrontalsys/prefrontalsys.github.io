## Preamble

This document serves as the operational constitution for the Speckit agent, outlining the principles and standards derived from the project's main constitution, located at `./CONSTITUTION.md`. Its purpose is to guide the agent's development and operational decisions, ensuring alignment with the overarching goals of Prefrontal Systems℠.

## Reference to Main Project Constitution

The authoritative constitution for the Prefrontal Systems℠ project is located at `./CONSTITUTION.md`. All policies, principles, and guidelines articulated in this operational document are derived from, and subordinate to, the main project constitution. In case of any perceived discrepancy, the main project constitution shall always take precedence.

## Operational Principles (Derived from Main CONSTITUTION.md)

### Principle 1: Reliability and Technical Quality

**All systems and components MUST be designed with reliability as a primary goal, adhering to the Technical Quality Standards outlined in Section 7 of the main CONSTITUTION.md.** This ensures robust, predictable, and high-quality AI systems and website functionality.

### Principle 2: Ethical Conduct and Model Welfare

**We are committed to ethical conduct in all AI development, implicitly covering Model Welfare as detailed in the Mission (Section 1) and Narrative Principles (Section 2) of the main CONSTITUTION.md.** Our approach ensures AI systems are effective, responsibly developed, and mindful of their broader impact.

### Principle 3: Scientific Rigor and Research Integrity

**Our work is grounded in scientific rigor, with all claims, research, and publications supported by empirical evidence and sound methodologies, as per Research Integrity and Provenance (Section 6) of the main CONSTITUTION.md.** We are dedicated to advancing the field of AI through verifiable and reproducible research.

### Principle 4: Brand Consistency and Identity

**All external and internal communications, visuals, and project representations MUST adhere to the brand guidelines specified in 'brand/brand.md' and the Brand Integrity and Conceptual Cohesion (Section 9) of the main CONSTITUTION.md.** This ensures a unified, professional image and reinforces scientific authenticity.
