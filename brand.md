## Licensing Strategy

### Open Source Licensing

**For Research Papers:**

```text
License: CC-BY 4.0 (Creative Commons Attribution)
```

- Requires attribution in all derivative works
- You get credit in every paper that cites you
- Establishes you as originator
- Maximum academic impact
- Cannot be revoked

**For Code (MCP Servers, Tools):**

```text
License: Apache 2.0 (recommended)
or
License: MIT (alternative)

```text
- Permissive but requires attribution
- Allows commercial use (encourages adoption)
- Patent grant protections (Apache only)
- Standard in industry
- Used by major open source projects

**For Core Framework (PrefrontalOS):**

```text
License: AGPL-3.0 (recommended for competitive protection)
or
Dual License: AGPL-3.0 + Commercial
```

**AGPL-3.0 Advantages:**

- Strong copyleft (derivatives must be open source)
- **Network copyleft:** If someone runs your code as a service, they must release their modifications
- Prevents proprietary competitors from freeloading
- Used by MongoDB, Grafana, GitLab for this reason
- Still allows commercial use (just requires sharing modifications)

**Dual Licensing Option:**

- Core framework: AGPL-3.0 (free, but share-alike)
- Commercial license: Pay for proprietary use
- Revenue opportunity from enterprises who can't accept AGPL
- Like MySQL, Qt, Elastic model

### Defensive Publication Strategy

**Why It Matters:**

- Publishing establishes **prior art**
- Prevents others from patenting your ideas
- Timestamps your work
- You were first = you have priority

**Your STOPPER Paper Already Did This:**

- DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.14487847
- No one can patent STOPPER now
- You published first
- Academic users must cite you

**Continue This Strategy:**

1. Publish papers on arXiv immediately
2. Get DOI through Zenodo for timestamping
3. Share on GitHub with commit history
4. Blog posts with timestamps
5. Social media announcements

**Result:** Iron-clad proof of origination and innovation priority

### Quality Checklist

Before using any image, verify:

- [ ] No people visible in image
- [ ] Scientific accuracy maintained
- [ ] Not generic AI/tech stock imagery
- [ ] Not a biology/technology chimera
- [ ] Appropriate resolution for use case
- [ ] Proper format (SVG for diagrams, PNG/JPG for photos)
- [ ] Attribution documented if required
- [ ] Brand colors applied tastefully (if applicable)
- [ ] Supports content meaningfully
- [ ] Aligns with research-driven brand identity

### Emergency Alternatives

**If struggling to find appropriate imagery:**

**Option 1: Use no image**
- Clean typography can stand alone
- Not every piece of content needs imagery
- White space is professional

**Option 2: Simple geometric pattern**
- Create basic network graph
- Use brand colors in abstract pattern
- Minimalist shapes suggesting structure

**Option 3: Custom diagram**
- Create simple flowchart or schematic
- Use brand style guide
- Focus on clarity over decoration

**Never resort to:**
- Generic stock photography "because we need something"
- AI-generated imagery that doesn't meet guidelines
- Off-brand imagery that undermines credibility
